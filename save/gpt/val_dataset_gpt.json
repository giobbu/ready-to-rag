Introduction \nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are security tools that provided to strengthen the security of communication and \ninformation systems. This approach is similar to other measur es such as antivirus software, firewalls and access control scheme s. \nConventionally, these systems have been classified as a signatu re detection system, an anomaly detection system or a hybrid \ndetection system [29]. In signature based detection, the system identifies patterns of traffic or application data is presumed to be \nmalicious while anomaly detection systems compare activities ag ainst a normal defined behavior. Hybrid intrusion detection \nsystems combine the techniques of both these approaches. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages. Few \nbenefits of anomaly detection techniques over others can be st ated as follows. Firstly, they are capable of detecting insider \nattacks. For example if any user is using any stolen account and perform such actions that are beyond normal profile of the user, \nan alarm will be generated by the anomaly detection system. Secondly, the detection system is based on custom made profiles. It  \nbecomes very difficult for an attacker to carry out any activity without setting off an  alarm. Finally, it can detect the attac ks that \nare previously not known. Anomaly detection systems look for anomal ous events rather than the attacks. In this paper we focus \nupon the various anomaly detection techniques. \n1.1. Anomaly Detection \nAnomaly detection is the process of finding the patterns in a dataset whose behavior is not normal on expected. These \nunexpected behaviors are also termed as anomalies or outliers. The anomalies cannot always be categorized as an attack but it can \n\u00a9 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V .

It may or may not be harmful. The anomaly detection provides very \nsignificant and critical information in various applications, for example Credit card thefts or identity thefts [1]. When data has to \nbe analyzed in order to find relationship or to predict kno wn or unknown data mining techniques are used. These include \nclustering, classification and machine based learning techniques. Hybrid approaches are also bei ng created in order to attain \nhigher level of accuracy on detecting anomalies. In this approach the authors try to combine existing data mining algorithms to  \nderive better results. Thus detecting the abnormal or unexpected behavior or anomalies will yield to study and categorize it in to \nnew type of attacks or any particular type  of intrusions. This survey attempts to provide a better understanding among the vari ous \ntypes of data mining approaches towards anomaly detection that has been made until now. \n1.2. Basic Methodology of anomaly detection technique \nAlthough different anomaly approaches exists, as shown in figure 1 parameter wise train a model prior to detection. \nParameterization: Pre processing data into a pre-established formats such that it is acceptable or in accordance with the targeted \nsystems behavior. \nFigure 1: Methodology of Anomaly Detection \nTraining stage: A model is built on the basis of normal (or abnormal) behavior of the system. There are different ways that can \nbe opted depending on the type of anomaly detection considered. It can be both manual and automatic. \nDetection stage: When the model for the system is ava ilable, it is compared with the (param eterized or the pre defined) observed \ntraffic. If the deviation found exceeds (or is less than when in the case of abnormality models) from a pre defined threshold t hen \nan alarm will be triggered. \n2. Anomaly Detection Using Data Mining Techniques \nAnomalies are pattern in the data that do not conform to a well defined normal behavior. The cause of anomaly may be a \nmalicious activity or some kind of intrusion. This abnormal behavior found in the dataset is interesting to the analyst and thi s is \nthe most important feature for anomaly detection [14].  \nAnomaly detection is a topic that had been covered under various survey, review articles and books [4, 5]. Phua et al  (2010) have \ndone a detailed survey on various fraud detection techniques that has been carried out in the past few years. They have defined  \nthe professional fraudster, the main types and subtypes of known fraud, and also presented the nature of data evidence collecte d \nwithin affected industries [6]. Padhy et al (2012) provided a detailed survey of data mining applications and its feature scope . \nThey stated that anomaly detection is an application of data mining where various data mining techniques can be applied [3] \nAmanpreet, Mishra, and Kumar (2012) described readymade data mining techniques that can be applied directly to detect the \nintrusion [7]. Garc\u00eda et al (2009) have surveyed the most relevant works in the field of automatic network intrusion detection \n[15]. They provided a wide prospective to the techniques that they can be practically  deployed by viewing the possible causes f or \nthe lack of acceptance to the proposed novel approaches. \nIn this paper review of different approaches of anomaly detec tion focuses on the broad classification of existing data mining \ntechniques.  Data mining consists of four classes of task; they are association rule learning, clustering, classification and \nregression. Next subsection presents anomaly detection techniques under these four classes of task:",
        "267c4b27-24d7-4511-a372-847c439b546e": "710   Shikha Agrawal and Jitendra Agrawal  /  Procedia Computer Science   60  ( 2015 )  708 \u2013 713 \n2.1. Clustering based Anomaly Detection techniques \nClustering can be defined as a division of data into group of similar objects. Each group, or cluster, consists of objects that  are \nsimilar to one another and dissimilar to objects in other groups [ 13]. Clustering algorithms are able to detect intrusions with out \nprior knowledge. There are various methods to perform clustering that can be applied for the anomaly detection. Following is th e \ndescription of some of the proposed approaches \n\u00be k-Means: k- Means clustering is a cluster analysis method where we define k disjoint clusters on the basis of the \nfeature value of the objects to be grouped. Here, k is the user defined parameter [9]. There has been a Network Data \nMining (NDM) approach which deploys the K-mean clusteri ng algorithm in order to separate time intervals with \nnormal and anomalous traffic in the training dataset. The resulting cluster centroids are then used for fast anomaly \ndetection in  monitoring of new data [10].  \n\u00be k-Medoids: This algorithm is very similar to the k-Means algorithm. It differs mainly in its representation of the \ndifferent clusters. Here each cluster is represented by the most centric object in the cluster, rather than by the implicit \nmean that may not belong to the cluster. The k-medoids method is more robust than the k-means algorithm in the \npresence of noise and outliers because a medoid is less influe nced by outliers or other extreme values than a mean. \nThis method detects network anomalies which contains unknown intrusion. It has been compared with various other \nclustering algorithms and have been find out that when it comes to accuracy, it produces much better results than k-\nMeans [11]. \n\u00be EM Clustering: T his algorithm can be viewed as an extension of k Means which assigns an object to the cluster to \nwhich it is similar, based on the mean of cluster. In this approach instead of assigning obj ect in the dedicated cluster, \nassign the object to a cluster according to a weight representing the probability of membership. In other words there \nare no strict boundaries in between the clusters. Here new mean is computed on the basis of weight measures [12]. \nWhen compared to k means and k medoids, EM outperformed them and resulted in higher accuracy [11]. \n\u00be Outlier Detection Algorithms: Outlier  detection is a technique to find patte rns in data that do not conform to expected \nbehavior. Since an outlier can be defined as a data point which is very different from the rest of the data, based on \ncertain measures. There are several outlier detection schemes. User can select any one of them on the basis of its \nefficiency and how he can deal the problem of anomaly detection. One of the approach is Distance based Approach \n[11]. It is based on the Nearest Neighbour algorithm and implements a well-defined distance metric to detect outliers. \nGreater the distance of the object to its neighbour, the more lik ely it is to be an outlier. It is an efficient approach in \ndetecting probing attacks an Denial of Service (DoS) atta cks.  Other one is Density based local outlier approach. \nDistance based outlier detection depend on the overall or globa l distribution of the given set of data points. The data \nis not uniformly distributed thus the distance based approach encounter various difficulties during analysis of data. \nThe main idea of this density based method is to assign to each data example a degree of being outlier, which is \ncalled the Local Outlier Factor (LOF). The outlier factor is local in the sense that only a restricted neighborhood of \neach object is considered [14]. Various other algorithms are proposed for anom aly detection in the Wireless Sensor \nNetworks (WSN). A hierarchical framework have been proposed to overcome challenges in WSN\u2019s where an \naccurate model and the approximated model is made learned at the remote server and sink nodes [8]. An \napproximated local outlier factor algorithm is also proposed which can be learned at the sink nodes for the detection \nmodel in WSN. These provide more efficient and accurate results. \n2.2.",

An \napproximated local outlier factor algorithm is also proposed which can be learned at the sink nodes for the detection \nmodel in WSN. These provide more efficient and accurate results. \n2.2.  Classification based anomaly detection \nClassification can be defined as a problem of identifying the category of new instances on the basis of a training set of data \ncontaining observations (or instances or tuples) whose category me mbership is known. The category can be termed as class label.  \nVarious instances can belong to one or many of the class labels. In machine learning, classification is considered as an instan ce of \nsupervised learning for example learning where a training set of  correctly-identified observations is available. An algorithm t hat \nimplements classification is known as a classifier. It is constr ucted to predict categorical labels or class label attribute. I n case of \nanomaly detection it will classify the data generally into two categories namely normal or abnormal. Following are common \nmachine learning technologies in anomaly detection \n\u00be Classification Tree: In  machine learning classification tree is also calle d as a prediction model or decision tree. It is a \ntree pattern graph which is similar to flow chart structur e; the internal nodes are a test property, each branch \nrepresents test result, and final nodes or leaves represent the class to which any object belongs. The most fundamental \nand common algorithm used for classification tree is ID3 and C4.5 There are two methods for tree construction, top-\ndown tree construction and bottom-up pruning. ID3 and C4.5 belong to top-down tree construction [16]. Further \nclassification tree approaches when compared to na\u00efve bayes classification, the result obtained from decision trees \nwas found to be more accurate [19]. \n\u00be Fuzzy Logic: It is  derived from fuzzy set theory which deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than precisely \ndeduced from classical predicate logic. The application side of fuzzy set theory deals with well thought out real world \nexpert values for a complex problem. In this approach the data  is classified on the basis of various statistical metrics.",
        "cbd4c57e-9060-43ac-ab2b-79f294a49bc8": "711 Shikha Agrawal and Jitendra Agrawal  /  Procedia Computer Science   60  ( 2015 )  708 \u2013 713 \nThese portions of data are applied with fuzzy logic rules to classify them as normal or malicious. There are various \nother fuzzy data mining techniques to extract patterns that represent normal behaviour for intrusion detection that \ndescribe a variety of modifications in the existing data mining algorithms in order to increase the efficiency and \naccuracy [17].  \n\u00be Na\u00efve bayes network:  T here are many cases where the statistical dependencies or the causal relationships between \nsystem variables exist. It can be difficult to precisely expr ess the probabilistic relationships among these variables. In \nother words, the former knowledge about the system is simply that some variable might be influenced by others. To \ntake advantage of this structural relationship between the random variables of a problem, a probabilistic graph model \ncalled Na\u00efve Baysian Networks (NB) can be used. This model provides answer to the questions like if few observed \nevents are given then what is the probability of a particular kind of attack. It can be done by using formula for \nconditional probability. The structure of a NB is typically represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where \neach node represents one of system variables and each link encodes the influence of one node upon another [21]. \nWhen decision tree and baysian techniques are compared, though the accuracy of decision tree is far better but \ncomputational time of baysian network is low [19]. Hence, when the data set is very large it will be efficient to use \nNB models. \n\u00be Genetic Algorithm:  I t was introduced in the field of computational biology. These algorithms belong to the larger \nclass of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). They generate so lutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired \nby natural evolution, such as inherita nce, selection, mutation and crossover. Since then, they have been applied in \nvarious fields with very promising results. In intrusion de tection, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to derive a \nset of classification rules from the network audit data. The support-confidence framework is utilized as a fitness \nfunction to judge the quality of each rule. Significant properties of GA are its robustness against noise and self-\nlearning capabilities. The advantages of GA techniques reported in case of anomaly detection are high attack \ndetection rate and lower false-positive rate [17]. \n\u00be Neural Networks:  It  is a set of interconnected nodes designed to imitate the functioning of the human brain. Each \nnode has a weighted connection to several other nodes in neighbouring layers. Individual nodes take the input \nreceived from connected nodes and use the weights together with a simple function to compute output values. Neural \nnetworks can be constructed for supervised or unsupervised learning [20]. The user specifies the number of hidden \nlayers as well as the number of nodes within a specific hidden layer. Depending on the application, the output layer of \nthe neural network may contain one or several nodes. Th e Multilayer Perceptions (MLP) neural networks have been \nvery successful in a variety of applications and producing more accurate results than other existing computational \nlearning models. They are capable of approximating to random accuracy, any continuous function as long as they \ncontain enough hidden units. This means that such models can form any classification decision boundary in feature \nspace and thus act as non-linear discriminate function. \n\u00be Support Vector Machine:  These are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and \nregression. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is widely applied to the field of pattern recognition. It is also used for an \nintrusion detection system. The one class SVM is based on one set of examples belonging to a particular class and no \nnegative examples rather than using positive and negative example [18]. When compared to neural networks in KDD \ncup data set, it was found out that SVM out performed NN in terms of false alarm rate and accuracy in most kind of \nattacks [18]. \n2.3. Hybrid approaches \nUsing any particular algorithm alone does not yield proper results. Now and then new attacks are registered thus using any sing le \nalgorithm will not suffice. In past few years approaches have b een made by either combining or merging different algorithms \ntogether. \n\u00be Cascading supervised techniques:  Here v arious classification algorithms are merged together in order to obtain \nhigher accuracy.",

A combination of na\u00efve bayes and decision tree algorithm was proposed. This hybrid algorithm was \ntested in Knowledge Data Discovery (KDD) cup dataset an d the accuracy achieved was 99 percent. It concentrated \non the development of the performance of Na\u00efve Bayesian (NB) classifier and ID3 algorithm [22]. A hybrid approach \nof merging Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was also proposed. It described about the \nensemble approach which used Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and hybrid DT-SVM classifier \nwith waits.
